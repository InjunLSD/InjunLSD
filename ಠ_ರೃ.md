	 Hello, My name is Dorian, LSDorian, Injun, or IllIll.
 I never had a lot of time growing up to sit down and see if I like playing with code, so I guess that's what I'm doing now.
I'm very ambitious, and understand I don't have enough time or a good enough memory to bring all of my ideas to fruition. That won't stop me from trying.

  I'm just now getting confident with my grasp of HTML/CSS, and plan to learn a great deal more *computerspeak* in the coming years.
Video games have always been my passion, and I hope to one day leave my mark on the industry; but I am fine with poking at existing code for a while to get my bearings.
Penetration testing had also interested me for a long time so maybe I should try that out too

If you found yourself here, reading this: I hope it's because I did such a good job that you HAD to see what else I've gotten involved with.
In that case, feel free to come hang out in my Discord server to find out what I'm working on *or* if you want to collaborate in some way. (https://discord.gg/tqWPSRNusc)
